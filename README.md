# FLIQ

> FLIQ is a learning engine-driven website for finding movies to watch. It uses a proprietary algorithm for building and evaluating user preferences based on what users tell FLIQ about what movies they like (or don't like).

## Team

FLIQ is being developed by four full-stack engineers.

* **Andrew Shih** - [ACS207](https://github.com/ACS207)
* **David Earle** - [dearle](https://github.com/dearle)
* **Rob Cornell** - [rcornell](https://github.com/rcornell)
* **Tae Lee** - [ta3woon](https://github.com/ta3woon)

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions if you want to fork the repo and start developing on your own. You do not need to follow these steps if you want to use our deployed build of [FLIQ](http://fliq.us-east-2.elasticbeanstalk.com).

### Prerequisites & Installing

1. Fork the repo and clone it to your development environment of choice.

2. To install FLIQ's dependencies, run the following command from the cloned repo's directory: 

```npm install```

### Configuration

You will need several API Keys to run your own build of FLIQ. We use the NPM package [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv) for our local environment variables. You should make a .env file, placed in your clone's root directory, that looks like this:

```
DB_USERNAME=(Your mysql db username)
DB_PASSWORD=(Your mysql db password)
DB_NAME=(Your mysql db name)
DB_PORT=(Your mysql db port)
DB_URL=(Your mysql db's URL)
PORT=(The port your build will run on)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID = (Google oauth client ID) // Available from [Google](https://console.developers.google.com)
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET = (Google oauth client secret) Available from [Google](https://console.developers.google.com)
OMDB_API_KEY = (Your omdbapi key) // Available for a small fee from [OMDBAPI](http://www.omdbapi.com/)
FACEBOOK_APP_ID = (Facebook oauth APP ID) // Available from [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/)
FACEBOOK_APP_SECRET = (Facebook oauth app secret) // Available from [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/)
QUOTE_API_KEY = (Your quote API key) // Available from [Mashape](https://market.mashape.com/andruxnet/random-famous-quotes)
YOUTUBE_API_KEY= (Youtube Data API key) // Available from [Google](https://console.developers.google.com)
FACEBOOK_OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL = (Your facebook oauth callback url) // Available from [Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/)
GOOGLE_OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL = (Your google oauth callback url) Available from [Google](https://console.developers.google.com)
```

Keep in mind that your database's environment variable requirements may be different. FLIQ is set up to use Sequelize with mysql.

## Usage

### Login

FLIQ needs to track your profile in order to learn about you, so start by logging in using either Google or Facebook. After that, start picking movies to teach our learning engine about what kind of movies you like (or don't like). If you want to tell FLIQ about specific movies you like or dislike, use the search function to pick out specific movies. When you want suggestions from the learning engine, click through to the results page.

Once you've logged in and built a profile for yourself, you can visit the Dashboard (through the hamburger menu) and see a visualization of your preferences. You can also view any trophies you may have earned while using the site.

If you want to watch movies with a group of people, try FLIQ's Movie Night feature. To use Movie Night, enter the e-mail addresses of other registered FLIQ users, then click the button for suggestions. FLIQ's learning engine will do its best to aggregate everyone's preferences and pick movies for you to see.

Users that ask FLIQ for suggestions without being logged in will be shown the entire userbase's favorite movies based on all aggregated preferences. You can pick movies in the lightning round, but these selections will not be tracked until you log in.
